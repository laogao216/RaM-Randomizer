# RaM-Randomizer
After getting sick and tired of using a random single int generator to generate random episodes of Rick and Morty, I wrote this handy tool to get a randomized episodes. It can be easily customized to work on any TV show by changing 2 lines, the array for number of episodes in each season and the url convention of a streaming site. I plan to make a pop up prompt part to make it more user friendly with processing library in the future...
